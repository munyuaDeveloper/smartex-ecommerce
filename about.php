<p>
  Following the Case study of the world of interior designing, I have discovered that it takes more than arranging furniture and fittings and applying color to a room and its surrounding but rather there is a detailed science behind it all. This does not come without major challenges and that is where my project provides a solution. People who come to Smartex have different tastes when it comes to interior designs and they would prefer to come up with their own ideas as well. By doing so, designers can visualize the kind of designs that attract different customers from different classes of life or social standards. The designer does thorough study on the new models of furniture and fittings their prices and the cost of redesigning and designing furniture and fittings.

  Another aspect of the Smartex Furniture Ngara is that, they buy materials from different vendors and even furniture and fittings as well. The designers then work on these commodities and transform them into works of art. A common design derived from materials such as tiles are the home fountains and wall gardens. They also take in old furniture and renew them and add new carvings or materials to make them look more attractive.  This adds value to the old furniture and can be resold to customers again which saves on cost of building new furniture and fittings.
